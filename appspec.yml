hooks:
# For each deployment lifecycle event, specify multiple "location" entries 
#   if you want to run multiple scripts during that event.
# You can specify "timeout" as the number of seconds to wait until failing the deployment 
#   Note that the maximum amount of time that all scripts must finish executing 
#   for each individual deployment lifecycle event is 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
# For deployments to Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, or RHEL instances,
#   you can specify "runas" in an event to run as the specified user.
# If you do not want to run any commands during a particular deployment
#   lifecycle event, remove that event declaration altogether. Blank or 
#   incomplete event declarations may cause associated deployments to fail.
# All the scripts specified in "location" start from the root of the revision's file bundle.
